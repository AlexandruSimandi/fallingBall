# fallingBall


I am going for something like this
* http://www.addictinggames.com/action-games/falldown2.jsp

Known bugs:
* total game failure on chrome, loop does not continue, also half the svg animations do not work
* depending on the height of the window, sometimes the lines can get really really close, REALLY REALLY CLOSE
* on pausing and unpausing the game (by pressing any key) the lines have tendency to get grouped

Todo:
* implement gravity so that the ball falls on the line below and also reacts to contact (almost like a bowling ball falling inside a climbing elevator)
* remember highscores using cookies (yeah real cookies)
* join the dark side
* pause game when changing tabs or windows (will look more into this)
* in future versions add difficulty, challenges or gradual increase in speed with time
